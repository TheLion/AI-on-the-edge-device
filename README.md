## Change log

------

### Known Issues

* slow response of web server during picture analysis
* spontaneous reboots (mostly due to html access during image processing) - self recovery implemented

------

**General remark:** Beside the `firmware.bin`, typically also the content of `/html` needs to be updated!



##### 8.4.0 - Multi Meter Support (2021-09-25)

* License change (remove MIT license, remark see below)

* html: show hostname in title and main page

* configuration: 

  * moved setting `ExtendedResolution` to individual number settings
  * New parameter `IgnoreLeadingNaN` (delete leading NaN's specifically)
  * **ATTENTION**: update of the `config.ini` needed (open, adjust `ExtendedResolution`, save)

* Bug fixing (html, images of recognized numbers)

  

### **ATTENTION: LICENSE CHANGE - removal of MIT License.** 

- Currently no licence published - copyright belongs to author
- If you are interested in a commercial usage or dedicated versions please contact the developer
  - no limits to private usage



##### 8.3.0 - Multi Meter Support (2021-09-12)

* Upgrade digital CNN to v12.1.0 (added new images)
* Dedicated NaN handling, internal refactoring (CNN-Handling)
* HTML: confirmation after config.ini update
* Bug fixing

##### 8.2.0 - Multi Meter Support (2021-08-24)

* Improve server responsiveness
* Flow status and prevalue status in overview
* Improved prevalue handling 

##### 8.1.0 - Multi Meter Support (2021-08-12)

* GPIO: using the general mqtt main topic for GPIO

* Upgrade digital CNN to v12.0.0  (added new images)
* Update tfmicro to new master (2021-08-07)

##### 8.0.5 - Multi Meter Support (2021-08-01)

* NEW 8.0.5: bug fix: saving prevalue
* NEW 8.0.4: bug fix: load config.ini after upgrade
* NEW 8.0.3: bug fix: reboot during `config.ini` handling, html error

* NEW 8.0.1: bug fix: html handling of parameter `FixedExposure` and `ImageSize`
* Dual / multi meter support (more than 1 number to be recognized)
  This is implemented with the feature "number" on the ROI definition as well as selected options
* MQTT: standardization of the naming - including new topics (`json`,  `freeMem `, `uptime`)c
* Preparation for extended GPIO support (thanks to Zwerk2k) - not tested and fully functional yet
* Bug fixing: html server, memory leak, MQTT connect, hostname, turn of flash LED

<span style="color: red;">**ATTENTION: the configuration and prevalue files are modified automatically and will not be backward compatible!**</span> 


## Additional ideas

There are some ideas and feature request, which are not followed currently - mainly due to capacity reasons on side of the developer. They are collected here: [FeatureRequest.md](FeatureRequest.md)
